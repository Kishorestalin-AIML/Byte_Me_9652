Ambulance Rerouting Effectiveness in Traffic Congestion

Problem Statement
In cities, heavy traffic congestion often delays ambulances, which can lead to critical loss of time during medical emergencies.  
Currently, ambulance routing, traffic clearance, and hospital preparation are handled using manual phone calls and delayed communication, resulting in poor coordination and slow response.

There is no single platform that connects:
- Ambulance drivers
- Hospitals
- Traffic inspectors  
in real time during emergencies.

---

Objective
The objective of this project is to improve ambulance rerouting effectiveness during traffic congestion by using a web-based dashboard that enables real-time tracking, coordination, and early hospital preparedness.

---

Proposed Solution
This project provides a web dashboard prototype that digitally connects ambulances, hospitals, and traffic authorities.

The system enables:
- Live ambulance tracking with ETA
- Traffic coordination support
- Early hospital alerts and preparation
- Status tracking and activity logs
- Snapshot sharing from ambulance to hospital

All features are implemented as extensions to an existing working dashboard, without redesigning the system.

---

Key Features
- Live ambulance GPS tracking using OpenStreetMap
- Real-time ETA and distance calculation
- Emergency snapshot image upload from ambulance
- Snapshot viewing in hospital dashboard
- Hospital readiness and case allocation
- Traffic inspector activity logs
- Shared real-time status bar
- Timing, logs, and alerts for accountability
- Role-based dashboard access

---

User Roles
  - Ambulance Driver
  - Raise emergency
  - Share live location
  - Upload snapshot image
  - View traffic updates and status

  - Hospital Emergency Coordinator
  - Receive early alerts
  - View ambulance location, ETA, and snapshot
  - Update hospital readiness (beds, ICU)
  - Prepare medical teams

  - Traffic Inspector
  - Monitor ambulance movement
  - Provide traffic clearance actions
  - Update traffic status in real time

---

Simple Workflow
1. Emergency occurs  
2. Ambulance driver raises emergency and uploads snapshot  
3. Ambulance is tracked live with ETA  
4. Traffic inspector clears traffic and updates status  
5. Hospital receives early alert and prepares resources  
6. Status updates are shared in real time  
7. Ambulance arrives and patient receives faster treatment  

---

Impact
- Reduced ambulance delay in traffic
- Faster hospital preparedness
- Improved coordination between ambulance, hospital, and traffic authorities
- Better emergency response outcomes

---

Technology Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenStreetMap
